This data visualization consist of a choropleth map and a word cloud. The word cloud library is from Jason Davies. For each year starting from 1970 to 2017, both visualizations display the number of times a specific nationality was targeted by terrorist attacks. First, user’s eyes will be drawn to the choromap map as this is the focus of the application.  We have legend on the corner with two descriptions of two different colors, one being white which has the minimum amount of attacks and the other being dark red being the maximum amount of attacks. Then we have a word cloud that displays very similar information, however the size of the font of country names will display how frequent a country is targeted. So for the largest font, the user may assume that the country was targeted many times a specified year and when the font is small then that country had minimal attacks, but is still included. In addition, you will see a list of buttons on the bottom of the visualization where a user can choose a specific year to display a new visualization. Both the map and the word cloud have corresponding data and if a year is specified then both visualizations will change to the new data of the year chosen. Also, a play button will cycle through the years of the dataset and visualization will change along the years. There is a pause button to stop the cycle. The whole view of the data visualization is on image below.

In the most recent years, the United States has not been a primary target as many Americans may believe that it is. As you go through the beginning of the years, specifically 1970’s, you will notice that the United States was a dark color throughout the years 1970-1976 and the word cloud’s largest country name displayed is United States. This means that the United States was targeted a significant amount during that time. This is interesting because during those years it is known as the Golden Age of Terrorism. In the 1970s, there were literally hundreds of terrorists bombings, shootings, and hijackings in the United States. The attackers that targeted Americans were nationalist and ethnic terrorists, religious zealots, and anti-war militants, and these attacks typically consisted of bombings of civilian targets in populated cities such as New York (Bergen, 2015). For example, The Weather Underground, an anti-war organization, targeted the Pentagon, the U.S. Capitol and banks, claimed credit for 25 bombings in 1975 alone(Bergen, 2015).  In between the years 1970 and 1979 The U.S. Department of Transportation found that there were 112 domestic plane hijackings. One of them being in 1972 when 3 hijackers demanded $10 million or they would crash the plane (Bergen, 2015). So hijackings were quite common during the 1970s. In the below link, is a article of a deeper description of the Golden Age of Terrorism in the United States.  The picture below shows the map and the word cloud in year 1970 with the United States as the highest frequently targeted country.

It appears that United States has not been targeted for terrorist attacks in the last 5 years as most Americans might believe. Recently in the last 5 years, you will see that the country name Iraq is usually the largest font in the word cloud. The choromap correlates with the word cloud because Iraq is a dark red color and the largest font in the word cloud. The reason for this is that there is a constant war power within the country Iraq and many attacks have (and on-going) occur in the country. If the user were to compare Iraq and the United States, there is a large difference with the frequencies of the country being targeted. The recent rise of attacks in Iraq is because of the movement of the Sunni Jihadist Movement. This movement in Islam is the struggle to build a good Muslim society, and to be at war with those who are non- believers (BBC, 2014). Jihadists see violent struggle as necessary to pave a road to restore God’s rule on Earth and much of their residency is in the middle eastern countries such as Iraq (BBC, 2014). Which is in digs deeper of the movement occurring in Iraq. The picture belows shows of the map and the word cloud declaring Iraq as the highest targeted country for terrorist attacks in 2017.
